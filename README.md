## 🛠 Tag Filtering Logic

- Tags are stored per task and shown below task text.
- The filter dropdown shows all unique tags across all tasks.
- Selecting a tag filters only the matching tasks.
- The filter only appears once at least one task is created.

---

## 🧩 Drag & Drop

Implemented using [SortableJS](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable).  
Reordering updates task display dynamically without page reload.
